</head>
<body>
    <h1>2. Motion in a Straight line</h1>
    <p>1.The state motion and rest are relative . Explain ?</p>
    <p1>A. Rest and motion are relative because they depend on the observer's frame of reference.
        Hence on the basis of the reference frame of the observer, the state of motion or state of rest appear to us.
        Hence they are relative .    </p1>
        <p>2. How to is average velocity different from instantaneous velocity ?</p>
        <p1>A. Average velocity : It is as the ration of total dispalcement to the total time taken .</p1>
         
        <p1>   Instantaneous velocity : It is the velocity of the particle at any instant time .</p1>
        <p>3. Give an example where the velocity of an object is zero but its acceleration is not zero ?</p>
        <p1>A. In case of vertically projected body, the velocity at maximum height is zero, but its acceleration
            is g, which is not zero . 
        </p1>
        <p>4. A vehicle travels half the distance L wiht speed v1 and the other half with speed v2. what is the average speed ? </p>
        <p1>A. let t1 and t2  are the time taken by the vechicle to cover first half [L/2] and next half [L/2] with velocities v1 and v2 respectively
            then t1 = L/2v1 and t2 = L/2v2 . Total disatance = L/2+L/2 =L
            Total time =t1 + t2 = L/2v1 + L/2v2 = L/2[v1+v2/v1v2]
            Average speed = L/t1 + t2 =L/L/2X(v1 + v2/v1v1)  
            Hence Average speed =2v1v2/v1+v2 .
        </p1>
        <p>5. Can the velocity of an object be in a direction other then the direction of acceleration of the object ?
            If so, give an example .
        </p>
        <p1>A. Yes , In case of an object projected vertically upwards, the velocity is directed vertically up wards but 
            acceleration due to gavity is directed vertically downwards .
        </p1>
        <p>6. A parachutist flying in an aeroplane jumps when it is at a height of 3km above ground. He opens his parachute when
            he is about 1km above ground. Describe his motion ? 
        </p>
        <p1>A. A parachutist jumped from an aeroplane at a height of 3km above the ground . Now he has two dimentional motion . 
            He possess uniform velocity equal to plane velocity in horizontal direction itll he opens parachute at a height 1km
            above the ground and he has vertical downward motion due to gravitational force . So he follows parabolic path till
            he opens parachute at a height 1km above the ground . After parachute is opended, we should consider ari resistance
            (viscous drag ), air buoyancy acting on him along with gravitational force. In presence of this forces the net acceleration
            will become zero after falling through certain height, he attains constant velocity called terminal velocity. Further
            he falls along a straight line downwards with the same terminal velocity till he reaches the ground .                </p1>

            <p>7. A bird holds a fruit in its beak and flies parallel to the ground . It lets go of the fruit at some height . 
                 Describe the trajectory of the fruit as it falls to the ground as seen by a)the bird b)a person on the ground ? 
            </p>
            <p1>A. A bird holds a fruit in its beak and flies parallel to the ground . the bird dropped the fruit at some height.
            </p1>
            <p2>a) The trajectory of the fruit as seen by the bird is vertically downwards. Because the bird and the fruit have same 
                velocity in horizontal direction
            </p2>
            <p3>b) The trajectory of the fruit as seen by a person on the ground is parabola. Because it possess velocity in horizontal
                direction and acceleration in vertical direction
            </p3>
